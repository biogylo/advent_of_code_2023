# Advent of code 2023
My name is Juan Francisco Navarro, and this is my attempt at doing the advent of code, 2023.

I wanted to learn how to use Rust, and really practice it, so this seemed to be a great opportunity for that.

The main does basically nothing. I am running everything off unit tests in the tests directory.
